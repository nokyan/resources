        Please run Resources once with debug logs enabled (if possible) and include the terminal output here. This helps us to get hardware and software information in a streamlined way.
        You can do this by running `flatpak run --env=RUST_LOG=resources=debug net.nokyan.Resources` in your terminal if you've installed Resources using Flatpak. Otherwise run `RUST_LOG=resources=debug resources`.
        Especially during process and app detection, personally identifiable information may be printed in the debug logs, please double-check that there's nothing inside that you don't want to be public. If your issue is unrelated to process/app detection, you can safely omit any messages that start with `DEBUG resources::utils::app`.
